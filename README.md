# Sorting Visualizer  

Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web-based project that brings sorting algorithms and core Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) concepts to life. It uses a **Spring Boot backend API** along with a **JavaScript-powered frontend** to dynamically visualize how algorithms operate step by step.  

This project is designed to help learners, students, and developers not only **see how algorithms work in real-time**, but also to interact with them, customize parameters, and compare their efficiency.

## 🚀 Features  

- 🎨 **Interactive Visualizations**  
  - Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort (with room for more).  
  - Step-by-step graphical representation of element swaps, comparisons, and array transformations.  

- ⚡ **Spring Boot REST APIs**  
  - Backend APIs written in **Java (Spring Boot)** to handle algorithm execution.  
  - APIs return sorting results, execution time, number of comparisons, and other metrics.  
  - Extensible architecture for adding new algorithms (both sorting and non-sorting).  

- 🎛️ **Customizable Controls**  
  - Adjust speed of visualization.  
  - Change array size and value range.  
  - Pause, play, or reset the visualization at any time.  

- 📊 **Performance Insights**  
  - Displays time complexity and execution statistics for each algorithm.  
  - Enables comparison between algorithms in terms of speed and efficiency.  

- 📈 **Future Expansion (DSA Modules)**  
  - Searching algorithms (Linear, Binary Search).  
  - Stack & Queue operations.  
  - Tree and Graph traversal visualizations (BFS, DFS, etc.).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for interactive visualizations)  
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java)  
- **APIs**: RESTful APIs for algorithm execution & metrics  
- **Others**: JSON for API responses, Modular design for easy addition of new algorithms

## 🎯 Project Goals  

- Make learning algorithms engaging and visual rather than abstract.  
- Provide an API-driven system where backend logic (Spring Boot) and frontend visualization (JavaScript) are cleanly separated.  
- Serve as both a **learning tool** and a **foundation project** for developers exploring DSA, Java, and Spring Boot integration with web technologies.
